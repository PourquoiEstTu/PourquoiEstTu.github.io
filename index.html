	<h2 id='background'>Background</h2>

	<p id='background-paragraph'>Vancouver is one of the largest and most well-known cities in Canada.
	The whole of B.C. is very diverse in terms of climate. Vancouver has certain factors
	unlike any other city which change its climate negatively and
	positively. An example of this is being on the coast of British Columbia.
	Climate change will have many impacts in Vancouver and the Greater Vancouver Area.
	This site will tell you about these impacts.</p>

	<h2 id='severe-weather-patterns-now'>Severe Weather Patterns Now</h2>

	<p id='severe-weather-patterns-now-p'>Every now and then, there are some severe weather events. Vancouver
	receives some of the most rain in <br>the
	whole of Canada. This is the most relevant and consistent pattern as Vancouver is known <br>for being a rainy city.
	The winter and fall months have more rain than the summer and spring months. <br>The city is located on the
	windward side of a mountain and as a result, Vancouver gets hit with winds <br>filled with moisture from
	the Pacific ocean. This also results in flooding being a common occurrence. <br>Floods occur often with long
	spells of rain. They can range from small amounts to more dangerous <br>with water submerging cars. Thunderstorms
	are not common in Vancouver and hurricanes even less so. <br>This is because the Pacific ocean is cold and cold
	water kills hurricanes. The same effect can be applied <br>to a thunderstorm, but with much less power and destructive
	force. Arctic air moves to Vancouver at <br>around the same time each year. This turns the heavy rains into equally
	powerful snow and winds. The <br>arctic air also affects this pattern due to the cold air it brings. In summary,
	heavy rain occurs consistently <br>in the wintertime and is at its peak in November. Wind and snow however, can
	only become dangerous <br>in winter.</br>
	</p>

	<h2 id='severe-weather-patterns-1968'>Severe Weather Patterns in 1968</h2>

	<p>Firstly, hurricanes, rainfall and thunderstorms followed the same pattern back then as well.
	Rainfall has <br>decreased slightly, but certain months get much more rain than others. The rest however,
	is starkly different. <br>The winters were colder back then. Year after year there were very intense winters.
	1968 was one of the <br>worst years. There was record-setting snow and temperature lows. Cold snaps were
	consistent occurrences <br>back then. Even though the graphs show that snowfall has increased in 2018, all of
	the snowfall happened in <br>one month. Snowfall in 1968 was in November, December and January. Winter was much
	harsher and had <br>consistent days where it was much too cold to go outside. Cold warnings happened often.
	On the other <br>hand, there were almost no heat waves and no droughts.</br>

	<h2 id='Amounts-of-Permanent-Ice-and-Frozen-Soil'>Amounts of Permanent Ice and Frozen Soil</h2>

	<p>There are five glaciers on Vancouver Island. They are very small glaciers and are becoming smaller
	year <br>after year. The largest is called the Comox glacier. It is 1 km3. It is now possible to see
	the rocks beneath it. <br>There are no areas in Vancouver which have permanent ice or frozen soil. </br>

	<p id='Extent-and-Duration-of-Ice-Cover-on-Lakes-in-Winter-p'>Most of the lakes in Vancouver are fed through various rivers.
	This creates unstable ice conditions.
	It is not <br>safe to skate on or walk on. Rivers with warm water and cold water counteract each other
	and lakes rarely <br>freeze now. The safe point for skating is when ice thickness is 5 inches.
	Two years ago, Trout Lake was the <br>only lake safe for skating. It was the first time in 20 years
	this had happened.</br>

	<h2 id='Changes-in-River-Flow-Ice-Cover-Flooding-and-or-Rainfall'>
	Changes in River Flow, Ice Cover, Flooding, and/or Rainfall</h2>

	<p>Rainfall has decreased in Vancouver. Snowfall has increased. Precipitation has decreased
	by about 200 mm. Snowfall increased by about 60 mm. River flow is increasing. Even though
	rainfall has decreased, glaciers melting has caused river flows to increase. Some river
	flows are also temporarily increased if there are sudden storms. River flow is still predictable
	but can be erratic. Technically, the chances of flooding have also increased because of the
	increase to water flow. In reality, the likelihood of occurrence still stay practically the same.
	The increase in river flow is not too abnormal and large. Ice cover has been constantly decreasing.
	The biggest glacier on Vancouver Island, the Comox glacier is 1 km3 currently. Rock is now
	poking out of the glacier. The glacier used to be much larger and there used to be almost 170 glaciers
	on Vancouver Island. There are currently 5. I talked about ice cover 2 slides ago.

	<p>The left side shows the river flow of 1968 and the right has the 2018 data. The blue line is indicative

	</p>

	<h2 id='Changes-to-the-Local-Ecosystems-and-or-Species'>Changes to the Local Ecosystems and/or Species</h2>

	<p>Fish species such as bull trout and salmon are dependent on the cold water coming to them
	from glaciers <br>naturally melting in summer. Due to more and more of glaciers melting,
	there is less cold water coming in and <br>putting various species under significant duress.
	The other side effect of glaciers melting will be that rivers may <br>flood various areas.
	These areas include the habitats of many land animals. They can include otters and beavers.
	<br>Their dens can be overrun because of flooding. Invading species are also gaining a climate in
	which they can <br>thrive. Plants such as purple loosestrife and hawkweed have already have a solid footing.
	There animals such <br>as the red-eared slider turtle. They already have no natural predators and
	they will gain even more of an <br>advantage because the climate will change to something that they
	are used to. Local ecosystems will be taken <br>over by these. There will be much more insects as well.
	These insects can destroy forests and this will further <br>reduce habitats for other animals.
	One of these insects is the western spruce budworm.</br>

	<h2 id='Changes-in-Severe-Weather-Patterns'>Changes in Severe Weather Patterns</h2>

	<p>There are significantly less harsh winters now. This means less blizzards, cold warnings
	and hailstorms <br>along with other events which are caused by harsh winters. Sudden rainfall
	storms which may cause flash <br>flooding are more common. Rainfall still consistently falls in
	many months of the year and as long as this <br>continues, flooding will always be a danger.
	Flash flooding is more uncommon as very prolonged rainfall <br>causes flooding. Heavier
	rainfall can cause landslides in mountainous areas. Wildfires closer to the interior <br>of BC
	occur more now as a result of hotter temperatures. An area which is affected is the Okanagan.</br>

	<h2 id='Unusual-Heat-Waves-and-Droughts'>Unusual Heat Waves and Droughts</h2>

	<p>Last July, the drought rating for northern BC and the coast were at level 2.
	This is because of the lack of rain. <br>This is an anomaly and immediately decreased in August
	and continued decreasing. Climate change may <br>make this happen more often but for now there is
	almost no threat. Heat waves have increased in the past <br>50 years but none have taken Vancouver
	by surprise. Most heat waves are forecasted to happen but the <br>small amount that are not are reported
	on as soon as they happen. The city has acted accordingly to these <br>to make it as safe as possible.</br>

	<p>The land is more susceptible to wildfire due to the temperatures rising but are more

	Winters are starting to <br>deter the insects lesser and so they have been affecting crops more and more.
	Invasive species and other <br>weeds have also played their part in this. Some farmers may use more
	pesticides because of this and <br>affect the land even more. The climate is allowing weeds and invasive
	plant species to grow better overall. <br>Droughts have not really affected farmland and farmers already
	have the ideas and technology to deal with <br>climate change.</br>

	Some Projected Impacts Which are Already Occurring</h2>

	<p id='Some-Projected-Impacts-Which-are-Already-Occurring-p'>Four of my projections have happened. 
	Summers are getting hotter each year. The pattern of increasing has also <br>become consistent. 
	There are a lot glaciers in BC and a lot of them are being
	melted or have already been melted. <br>This is also increasing the amount of sunlight being absorbed
	by the ground. Winters have already dropped much <br>below what they used to be in Vancouver.
	Temperatures have been getting hotter and are still. Snowfall has <br>increased but only drops large
	amounts in one month. It rains much more in the winter months currently than in <br>the past.
	The summer months have had an increase of around 1.5 degrees in the past 50 years.
	Global warming <br>has not stopped which means that there will be larger increases in temperature in
	later years. As I wrote before, <br>other things which reflect light back into the atmosphere are
	slowly disappearing. Glaciers are a major source <br>which are disappearing and even snow only fell
	in February in 2018. Even though the last cold snap in Vancouver <br>was 2 years ago, it was the tenth
	longest ever. As temperatures are rising, the effects of the arctic air will become <br>less and less
	noticeable. Colder days will become less common and so will cold snaps.

	<p id='glaciers-in-vancouver-p'>Glaciers, Glacier Bay National Park.</p>

	<h2 id='Summary'>Summary</h2>

	<p>Precipitation has decreased on average. This could be attributed to the fact that
	climate change countering the effect of the arctic air is outweighing the effect of
	climate change on the evaporation of the ocean water which comes on to Vancouver.
	River flow has increased even though precipitation has decreased. This is because of
	the amount of glaciers melting. Precipitation has not decreased that much either and a lot
	of snow now comes in short spurts. The chance of flooding has increased due to the increase of
	water flow and rain coming in short spurts in a short time. Ice cover has decreased significantly
	as many glaciers in the Vancouver are melting. Many have already completely melted. Native species
	are taking the brunt of the damage from climate change. Many fish are dependent on the
	temperature of the water and the glaciers completely melting stops the temperature of the water
	staying consistent season after season. Animals such as beavers or others who make habitats
	underwater may have their homes flooded. Invasive species who thrive in hotter climates will
	gain stronger holds in many ecosystems and may destroy the biodiversity of those areas.
	Blizzards and any other severe weather events in winter happen rarely. Flooding and flash flooding
	is more likely to occur because it rains often in Vancouver. Residents should always be prepared for one.
	In some mountainous areas, there may be landslides but this is unlikely and does not happen often either.
	Wildfires in areas like the Okanagan are likely to happen in summer but with climate change the fire
	season may increase. Heat waves and droughts are still very rare occurrences. There was a bit of a
	spike in 2018 and the drought rating was level 2 but it has stabilized ever since. Agricultural lands
	will gain a longer growing season but also a bit of a higher chance of a wildfire. Pests and weeds have
	increased in number due to a warmer climate and farmers will have to monitor their fields more often to
	make sure crops are not affected. Vancouver is one of the best cities to live in Canada but its median
	income hangs around Canada’s average. Vancouver’s house prices are in an period of great increase and
	have not leveled off. Overall Vancouver is full of beautiful sights and facilities for many things
	such as science and technology. Vancouver is full of cultural diversity. There are areas and
	neighborhoods which have Chinese, Indian, and Italian businesses. Japanese culture is around even more
	with cherry blossoms. There are many different festivals which range from a variety of activities such
	as fireworks, wine, and the cherry blossoms as well. Hockey is also very large in Vancouver since
	they have the Canucks located there. There are no limitations to the information and technology that
	someone in Vancouver cannot obtain except for the limitations of the person them self. Vancouver has
	plenty of places where people can get these things such as libraries, various facilities, and even
	normal stores. A couple of my projections are currently happening. Summers are getting hotter.
	Winters have also became less cold. Temperatures are not only rising in summer months but also
	in every other month as well. The last projection which is happening are the cold snaps becoming much
	less common. All of these changes are directly related to the direct and indirect effects of
	climate change.

	<h3><i>Vancouver has a lot of flexibility in dealing with this problem</i></h3>

	<h2 id='Major-Aspects-of-Life-Which-Would-be-Affected-by-Climate-Change'>
	Major Aspects of Life Which Would be Affected by Climate Change</h2>

	<p>Outside life would be greatly affected. This is because the amount of rainfall is
	projected to increase. <br>People would now not only be worried about frequency but also about the
	strength of rain. Rain will <br>become strong enough to damage infrastructure. Citizens would also be
	need to be prepared for common <br>flooding. Longer growing seasons will be countered by more often
	and worse droughts. Something I have <br>said before as well, the threats of pests, invasive species,
	and other negative factors will be amplified <br>because they thrive in hotter climates. Like droughts,
	heat waves will also happen more often and become <br>more dangerous. Something else I wrote before,
	wildfires will occur more often in dry places. The average <br>temperature is predicted to increase by
	2.7 degrees celsius. Another obvious impact, glaciers in BC as a <br>whole are projected to recede by
	70% by 2100. This will further change river flows and temperatures. <br>This will also affect hydroelectric
	power generation as well as the quality and amount of drinking water. <br>The glaciers receding will also
	mean that year after year, the increase of drinking water in summer due to <br>natural glacier melting will
	disappear. For a city as big as Vancouver this will pose a large problem to the <br>municipality.
	The last major impact is that the rising sea level may have severe effects on the B.C.’s <br>coastal
	communities. These communities will experience more dangerous floods more often. Another
	<br>consequence of this is that sewage and drainage systems will be overwhelmed. More and more
	<br>infrastructure will need to be repaired and strengthened often. Low lying agricultural areas will
	also <br>become too saline to support crops. An area which would be affected is the Saanich Peninsula on
	<br>Vancouver Island. This area has a very good climate for crops and will be a huge hit for the
	residents of <br>that area. Many chefs there choose only to use local crops and this also creates a
	small hub for tourism. <br>Just like the rest of Vancouver, land in the peninsula has become very expensive
	for a couple of acres. <br>All of this money as well as the tourists and food businesses will
	dwindle in number as well.

	<h2 id='Ways-People-can-Reduce-Their-Emissions-of-Greenhouse-Gases'>
	Ways People can Reduce Their Emissions of Greenhouse Gases</h2>

	<p>Overall, Vancouver’s greenhouse gas emissions have decreased. The change is not very large
	but it is still an <br>improvement for a city as big Vancouver. One of the ways to decrease greenhouse
	gas emissions is to reduce <br>consumption of fossil fuels. This is one of the reasons that emissions
	have decreased currently. The <br>petroleum and cement industries are also contributing a lot of emissions.
	Some ways to decrease these <br>emissions is to make the machines in these factories more efficient.
	This will most likely be easy to do and <br>desirable for this industry. More efficient machines will
	mean more output from less input. This would mean <br>that not only would these companies be able to
	make more money and expand operations, they would be able <br>to keep up with the city’s goals to
	decrease emissions. Another leading cause of emissions are vehicles. This <br>is because of the rising
	population and economy. This can be reduced by adding to the infrastructure for public <br>transportation.
	Vancouver already has a lot trains and buses for people to use but the continuing increase in <br>population
	will need easier access. Public transportation can be made easier to obtain through adding more <br>stops
	on existing and new routes, making tickets or cards available in more places and cheaper.
	The <br>municipality of Vancouver could also give companies incentives for using and improving trains and buses.
	<br>For example, the government could work with a tech company to add wireless charging pads and better online
	<br>services to buses and trains. Along with public transportation, more bike lanes will also be good for the
	<br>environment and a small, inexpensive change to roads. Another way to decrease vehicle emissions is to
	pour <br>more effort into developing electric, hybrid and hydrogen powered cars. Companies like Tesla
	have already <br>been pioneering these and the only downside is the cost. With Tesla now working on a
	cheaper car, it can lead <br>the way for other businesses do the same. Electric cars have always been one
	of the symbols of the future and <br>the faster they become reality for the middle class, the faster
	emissions will decrease. My last way is the most <br>obvious one, but reducing the amount of fossil fuels in
	all industries such as construction and in energy <br>production. This can be done by stopping the use
	of fossil fuel powered machines, making machines which <br>must use fossil fuels more efficient, make different
	products much better than fossil fuel powered alternatives, <br>and spend more time innovating all alternative
	energy products to be more useful and better overall. One more <br>way is to increase the generation of
	sustainable energy. 89% of British Columbia’s electricity is generated from <br>hydro plants. This is very
	good and needs to continue. Wind energy makes up around 1% of B.C.’s electricity. <br>This is very simple to
	improve as the offshore wind farms could make up a lot more.

	<h2 id='Steps-by-the-Local-Government-Businesses-and-Individuals-to-Adapt-to-Climate-Change'>
	Steps by the Local Government, Businesses, and Individuals to Adapt to Climate Change</h2>

	<p>The municipality of Vancouver has made an action plan of targets they intend to meet.
	This plan will include <br>an investment to a reduction in energy use, an increase in the use and
	supply of renewable energy. Some <br>ways they are thinking fulfill the first part of their plan
	is by improving the bike network across the city and <br>by building new renewable buildings.
	These buildings will use renewable energy and for heating and hot <br>water. As a result, the building
	will be less expensive for both of these things. This will also affect <br>businesses as new offices will
	follow this model. A couple of methods they will use to follow through on <br>the second part of the
	plan is by expanding the energy operations and adding more buildings to utilities <br>which use
	renewable energy and by encouraging people to people to use transit more often. A few ways <br>they are
	thinking about succeeding in the final step of their plan will be done by advocating for more <br>rooftop
	solar panels and for electric and hybrid vehicles. These are the examples given by the government <br>and they
	are planning to do more as well. A lot of the companies in the fossil fuels industry are joining <br>different
	climate change projects. An example of this is the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers <br>(CAPP).
	This association works with petroleum companies to make policies for these companies which <br>help them
	work with and abide by Canada’s climate pledges. They make changes where they are most <br>efficient and
	productive. They also make sure that these changes do not negatively affect Canadians, the <br>economy
	and the industry. While this group of companies does meet and try to exceed the standards that <br>Canada places
	on them, their priorities still lie with the economy. Shell Canada and other oil companies are <br>also starting
	to support a carbon tax because economists are saying that it is the best first step to reduce <br>emissions.
	Other businesses are not as involved with the climate issue as the fossil fuel corporations so <br>they are
	just following what the government is saying and trying not to get a bad reputation from the media.
	<br>Citizens in Vancouver are following what the local government is doing. Many citizens are also forming
	<br>groups where they meet up to discuss different issues. There are also groups which change things in their
	<br>house to reduce their environmental impact. An example is that a citizen in Vancouver made a list of <br>actions
	that most citizens can do to reduce their carbon footprint. Some citizens are ingenuitive in the way <br>they
	reduce their carbon footprint. As a whole, citizens agree with the government and will support them.

	<h2 id='Ways-these-Entities-are-Adapting-to-the-Coming-Changes-in-Climate'>
	Ways these Entities are Adapting to the Coming Changes in Climate</h2>

	<p>The local government is adapting to the coming changes by being more prepared and proactive to the
	<br>projected changes. The government has made the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. This will propose
	<br>new actions which will be effective regardless of the effect of climate change. They are doing research
	to <br>predict the effects of climate change and categorize them based on a risk and vulnerability evaluation.
	<br>Their first actions are focusing on finishing a stormwater management plan, finishing a coastal
	flood risk <br>evaluation, changing flood-proofing policies in line with the projected effects of climate change,
	finishing <br>an urban forest management plan, developing a back-up power policy, and realizing water
	conservation <br>actions. All of the knowledge the government has gain from doing these various assessments will
	be put <br>to the test in the near future. Most businesses such as restaurants and service agencies will agree
	with <br>what the government will say as they do not have a major stake within the climate change problem,
	the <br>fossil fuel industry is different. They are starting to change their mind about climate change and
	not lobby <br>against reasonable climate change policies. Companies in this history have long-had information
	about <br>climate change but decided to deny it because they thought that it would ruin their profits.
	Now, they <br>realize that climate change will shift the world’s eyes and will push it to renewable energy
	sources much <br>faster. The only way for the fossil fuel industry to survive is to change itself into an
	industry which can <br>survive in the harsher and stricter conditions of carbon requirements. This is how
	the huge corporations <br>will act down the line, and this what many of the CEO’s of these large companies are
	announcing. They <br>will start finding the different products they can provide which will be necessary
	to keep them flourishing. <br>They will give their best efforts to stay relevant in a low carbon future.
	They will continue to assess the <br>effects of climate change on their business and will most likely try
	to make their machines as efficient as <br>possible for now and continue to wade the waters to make
	adjustments with the situation and time. <br>Citizens in this scenario have little they can do other than
	keep up with the government’s policies. They <br>will have to adjust their life based on government assessments.
	The best thing they can do right now is <br>to move proactively to what the government plans to do in the
	future and put themselves in the safest <br>position possible. This is what they are doing right now and I
	think it is the best way to secure a positive <br>future.

	<!-- Think about removing this and just keeping the "My Preferred Solution" -->
	<h2 id='Possible-Solutions'>Possible Solutions</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Reduce all greenhouse gas emissions with calculated steps</li>
			<li>Give incentives to businesses, factories, homeowners, and etc. to stop using fossil fuels</li>
			<li>Invest heavily in infrastructure throughout the city to make the city more green and
			less reliant on pollutants</li>
			<li>Follow along with the provincial and national actions against climate change</li>
			<li>Do more in-depth research to find the best possible solution for the future which is
			less costly and more effective</li>
		</ul>

	<h2 id='My-Preferred-Solution'>My Preferred Solution</h2>

	<h3><b>Reduce all greenhouse gas emissions with calculated steps</b></h3>

	<p>This would be the best solution in my opinion because it is the most thorough and the one with
	the most flexibility. This would allow Vancouver to make preemptive actions now and also let them
	watch climate change go its course. They have already done plenty of research and have enough resources
	to go through with any decisions they want to make. They can cover all of the areas of greenhouse
	gas emissions and devote different resources to each. To be able to deal with climate change properly,
	resources have to be spent accurately to not waste them. This is a large scale problem where it is best
	to have the most convenient methods. All of the questions which I listed in this section to consider
	for my solution are taken into account. There are many different factors at play right now such as large
	corporations, government officials, the scientific community and many others. All of them share a
	common goal with climate change but their purposes are all different. Anything which is deemed by
	one of these factors to be damaging or slightly negative to them could shift their entire perspective
	on the issue. The solution allows a degree of backtracking which is necessary to obtain optimal results.
	This is why I believe this to be the best solution.
